Lightning Wallet is an [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability#Simplified_payment_verification) Bitcoin node with a Lightning node built on top of it, both available within the same Android app. 

It allows you to send and receive a regular on-chain Bitcoin transactions which are recorded on a public Bitcoin blockchain, take minutes to hours to settle, have relatively high fees and are intended for substatial value transfers.

And then it also lets you send an [off-chain Bitcoin transactions](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Off-Chain_Transactions) also known as Lightning payments which are private, nearly instant, have low fees while still do not rely on a [trusted third party](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/) of any kind.

### [](#a-very-important-message)A very important message

It is crucial to understand that Lightning Wallet is not a thin client to some centralized service but instead it is a sovereign Bitcoin and Lightning node which most importantly means that your money is stored right on your phone and nowhere else.

This gives you a ultimate censorship resistance: no one can "freeze your account" or cancel your transactions but at the same time it makes you the one responsible for securing your funds.

Thankfully, a wallet is designed in such a way that if you do everything right you would never lose your money no matter what. *Please be sure to read an [Essential app guide](setting-up-bitcoin-wallet.html#setting-up-bitcoin-wallet) if you do want to use this app!*
