### [](#using-lightning-wallet)Using Lightning wallet

Once Bitcoin wallet is created you can also start using a Lightning wallet by opening a payment channel with a peer of your choice and using it to send payments across a Lightning network.

### [](#payment-channel)Payment channel

Technically speaking it is a multisig lockbox on a Bitcoin blockchain which is mutually controlled by you and a peer of your choice. It is designed in such a way that once a certain amount of coins is locked in there you can use those coins to send and receive Lightning payments. 

You can close a payment channel and get the rest of your locked coins back to your Bitcoin wallet at any time, either by agreeing with a peer on a mutual closing transaction or via forced channel closing if your peer becomes uncooperative.

### [](#forced-channel-closing)Forced channel closing

This is an option which is always available to both you and your peer once a new payment channel is open. No matter what happens a channel can always be closed without peer's permission with the rest of channel balance refunded back to your Bitcoin wallet.

That said, a refunding Bitcoin transaction created by forced channel closing is encumbered in a time lock of 144 Bitcoin blocks so closing a channel uncooperatively will take about one day of waiting before your channel coins are sent back to your Bitcoin wallet.

### [](#commit-transaction-fee)Commit transaction fee

You may encounter a message which says that your Lightning payment sum exceeds a Bitcoin commit transaction fee when you try to send a payment while your channel balance is low.

This may sound strange since Lightning payment is an off-chan value transfer so what does an on-chain Bitcoin commit transaction have to do with it?

The answer is although sending each Lightning payment indeed does not involve broadcasting a Bitcoin transaction, such a transaction has to be created nevertheless and it must have an appropriate fee for Bitcoin network to accept it in a timely manner.

So an actual amount available for spending in a payment channel will always be slightly less than a nominal amount because it always needs to contain enough funds for current Bitcoin commit transaction fee should it ever be broadcasted.
